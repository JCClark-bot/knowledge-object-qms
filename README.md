# AI-Driven Knowledge Object QMS

This repository contains the original white paper and schema authored by Jared Clark (2025-09-30) to establish prior art for an AI-native Quality Management System (QMS).

- `CAPA_SCHEMA.json` â€” Example schema for a CAPA knowledge object

## ðŸ§­ Purpose
Traditional QMS systems are document-centric, slow, and compliance-heavy.  
This work introduces a **knowledge-objectâ€“driven model**, where AI guides record creation, embeds compliance requirements, and ensures records are:

- **Immutable** â€” full version history, never deleted  
- **Traceable** â€” who/when/why captured automatically  
- **Auditable** â€” instantly retrievable for FDA/ISO  
- **21 CFR Part 11â€“compliant** â€” secure e-signatures and approvals  

The system also includes an **Action Agent layer** that tracks obligations, reminders, and escalations, closing the loop between record creation and compliance execution.

## ðŸ”— Strategic Impact
- Enables **decentralized quality management** by embedding quality intelligence into each department.  
- Offers **ERP integration** to replace or enhance weak ERP quality modules.  
- Provides **audit-ready compliance** at lower cost, especially for SMBs in cosmetics, dietary supplements, and food manufacturing.
